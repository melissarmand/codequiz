## My task

I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz
with multiple choice questions. This app was to run in a browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS and was to be powered by JavaScript.

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
